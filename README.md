# Predicting Risk of Default using Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)
## Motivation
I had the oportunity to attend a hackathon organized by The World Bank with the aim to explore new ways of extracting valuable insight from their data that would contribute towards their mission. The World Bank's mission is "to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and building shared prosperity".  
The World Bank like any other banking institution has limited resources, and the efficient allocation of this resources is crucial to achieve the bank's goals. With various country competing for financing options to improve their countries, how do we choose go gets the resources they need?  
In this project, I look into country governance indicators and how they impact the country's risk of default as rated by independet sovereign debt credit agency's. The main question to be answered is, how does government indicators impact risk of defaut?
