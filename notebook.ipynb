    "# Predicting Sovereign Credit Ratings using The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "I had the opportunity to attend a hackathon at The Wolrd Bank and got to know first-hand about their mission: \"to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme poverty and building shared prosperity\". After beign separated into teams, my team got assigned the task to predict loan repayment risk using solely country governance indicators developed by The World Bank. During the assigned time, we mostly accomplished realising how hard assessing risk was for The World Bank when considering loan repayment risk from its member countries, especifically developing ones with precarious financial systems. At the end, we were asked what would we do given more time to develop a full feldged roject. I took on the changellenge and started working on this project.\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "In this project, I will be using The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) as model features and historical sovereign ratings since 2014 as the target variable. The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) project reports aggregate and individual governance indicators for over 200 countries and territories over the period 1996–2018, for six dimensions of governance:\n",
    "- Voice and Accountability\n",
    "- Political Stability and Absence of Violence\n",
    "- Government Effectiveness\n",
    "- Regulatory Quality\n",
    "- Rule of Law\n",
    "- Control of Corruption\n",
    "\n",
    "These aggregate indicators combine the views of a large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries.  They are based on over 30 individual data sources produced by a variety of survey institutes, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and private sector firms. Governance consists of the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.  This includes the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.[source: https://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/]\n",
    "\n",
    "Sovereign credit rating, is an evaluation made by a credit rating agency and evaluates the credit worthiness of the issuer (country or government) of debt. The credit rating is used by individuals and entities that purchase debt by governments to determine the likelihood that will pay its debt obligations.[source: https://countryeconomy.com/ratings]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Project Framework and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, I will use the OSEMiN framework: Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret. After obtaining the variables from their resective sources I will scrub them, looking for missing values, outiliers, and data transofrmations. I will cointinue to ecplore their distributions and extract some insight regarding country governance through time-series analysis and statistical testing. The predictive model will attempt to predict long-term sovereign credit rating using the country's governance state at the time of rating issuance. Finally, I will interpret the results and provide a conclusion from the findings.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. Obtain Data\n",
    "I'm going to start with the data from The Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) website. Form this I will get the variables that are going to be used as features of the predictive model.\n",
